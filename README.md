Set up the environmnet by cloning the repo and then downloading the necessary requirements from environment.txt. 

The dataset in students.csv is an uncleaned dataset of 100 students. There are missing values and the majors are not formatted well. 

The notebook eda.ipynb cleans and visualizes the dataset, which is stored in students_clean.csv after being processed.
